Introduction
------------

Pynotebook is a command shell for interactive computing following the
notebook concept. The notebook concept originally appeared with the
program Mathematica and became famous for python with the iPython
project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook does not need a webbrowser and is
very light weight.

Pynotebook has the following features: 

- command completion (tab-key)
- syntax highlighting
- small size 
- no external dependencies (except wx)

It can be easily embedded in projects and works well with matplotlib.

As a demo application, there is a simple notebook interface to the r
language, which uses rpy2 for interfacing gnu r and pygments for
colorization.
